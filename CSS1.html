      <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> allows you to create great-looking web
        pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
        CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about
        the language.<br /><br />
        CSS is designed to enable:-><br /><br />* the separation of content and
        presentation,<br />* including layout,<br />
        * colors, and fonts.<br />[3] This separation can improve content
        accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and
        control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br />
        ->enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
        relevant CSS in a separate .<br />-> css file, which reduces complexity
        and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .<br />-> css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.<br /><br />

        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
        the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
        methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
        or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
        rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
        device.[4]<br /><br />

        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property
        match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
        predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered
        for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
        validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br /><br />

        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
        including:-><br /><br />
        > XHTML,<br />
        > plain XML,<br />
        > SVG,<br />
        > XUL.<br />
        CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.

      <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; 02. CSS USES & SYNTAX ?</h3>
      <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        NOTE :-><br /><br />
        A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a
        computer program that represents a person inside a computer system.
        Browsers are the main type of user agents we think of when talking about
        CSS, however, they are not the only ones. There are other user agents
        available, such as those that convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs
        to be printed. CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by
        specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular
        elements or groups of elements on your web page.<br /><br />

        For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be
        shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule
        that would achieve the styling described above:<br /><br />

        # CSS :-><br />
        * { font-family: cursive;} <br> 
           <br> body { margin: 0; }
      </p>
    </div>
