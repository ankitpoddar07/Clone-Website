        <br /><br />

        1989: Berners-Lee first proposed the WWW while working at CERN, the
        European Organization for Nuclear Research. <br />

        1990: The first website, server, and browser went live at CERN. <br />

        1991: The first web page was published on August 6, 1991, by
        Berners-Lee. The page was dedicated to the WWW project and was hosted on
        Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. <br />

        1993: The WWW was put into the public domain by CERN. The World Wide Web
        began to be used in everyday life. <br />

        1994: The first International World Wide Web conference was held at
        CERN. <br />

        1995: The number of websites had grown to around 23,500. <br />
        <b>
          The early web pages were mostly text-based, and lacked special design
          or page structure. However, they did include basic HTML tags for
          headers, paragraphs, and links. The history of the web has seen many
          changes, including the ability to shop online, work from home, and
          connect with people around the world.
