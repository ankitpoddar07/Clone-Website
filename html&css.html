      <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; 01.WHAT IS HTML ?</h3>
      <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the
        standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a combination
        of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web
        pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the
        tag to define the structure of web pages. This language is used to
        annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can
        understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages
        (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what
        manipulation has to be done on the text.<br /><br />
